## Flying Etiquette Survey Analysis
### Why This Question?
I picked this question because I found it interesting whether or not it is a good idea to speak to someone sitting next to you on the plane. There is a big dilema whether or not it is disrespectful since you are in someones personal space.
### Chart & Findings
The chart represents the amount of individuals that either find it not rude, somewhat rude, and very rude to start a conversation with the person sitting next to you on a plane. The results show the following:
-No, not at all rude: 78.95%
-Yes, somewhat rude: 17.89%
-Yes, very rude: 3.16% 
I found it interesting that most people do not find it rude if the person sitting next to them decides to speak to them. This shows that most people crave social interaction yet society is led to believe that you are supposed to be individualistic and keep to yourself.
